/*
* The #include includes the headerfile for standart input/output stuff such as printf() and scanf()
* int main() creates a function, the Main-Function which is needed in every C-Program
* printf() prints a STRING, a couple of letters, numbers etc. ( careful with the \-sign/backslash )
* every C-Program has to return some value. This returns 0, which means that the program ran successfully
